This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to undefined variables.  When you try to access a variable that hasn't been defined, PHP will throw a notice.  However, the code continues execution, which can lead to unexpected results.

```php
<?php
  // Undefined variable
  echo $undefinedVar;

  // Using a variable before assigning it
  echo $anotherUndefinedVar += 10;
?>
```
